# Packages/Libraries for Search Engine Style Searching

One of the most important things in building any project is to look at what other people have built and see if it is in some way related to what you are tying to do.
We often refer to this as not "reinventing the wheel."

Here are some libraries I found that we may or may not use in the search functionality.

##lunr.js

Uses a series of functions or "pipelines" to process text.

For a brief demo on how this works go under the Examples tab.

Note that the search bar filters results as you type in each character.

##Fuse.js

"No server side logic required." (Not true) 

Uses the Bitap Algorithm.

##Fullproof

Uses a "BooleanEngine" hooked on metaphone.

Also includes a "ScoringEngine" Functionality. (Demo not working!)

##Faceted Search Javascript Library

Allows you to "filter, sort, and display large datasets in the browser."

##Python

You can create your very own search engine using Python.
