## Description
This will be the storage place of all things related to Technology.

Throughout the course of the project, I will be posting useful documentation for everyone to refer to when talking about the technologies we are using. Also, I will be posting sample code that serve as ideas or pieces that we can use in the project.

## Data Analysis

We talked about using DC Open Data as a our Data Source. After much thought, I believe the better approach is to stick with RIDB since it gives us richer data. It just takes more time for us to organize the data because the API isn't always clear about what number values mean.

To that end, I have fixed some of the API queries from this week. You can find updated queries in RIDB-API.md.
As I mentioned RESTful APIs are nice in that we can look at the data directly in our browser because REST uses the
same protocol as HTTP.

Please download this chrome plugin to "pretty print" JSON so you see each of the values and pairs.

Take notes about the data we are interested in. The API provides a lot of data for us but a lot of it is extra. Refer to the RIDB website and look at other queries of other data that we may need and let me know so I can provide more links to HTTP requests.
