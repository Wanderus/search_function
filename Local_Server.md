# Local Server

One of them most important aspect of software development is creating a local server to assist us with development. We can use it to see waht features will look like before we deploy the application. 

For javascript, we can set up a local server with Node.js. 

Node.js is a framework designed to create connections and handle them concurrently. One very useful aspect of Node is that we can set up a local server in our terminal and use it to run Javascript on the server side. 

Here is the link to the official website:

As we start to move deeper into the project, you will have to install node on your computer to run server side code. 

After installation, you can run a script in your terminal window that will allow you to run javascript code on the server.
